		<h2>The <u class="one">null</u> And The <u class="two">null</u></h2>
		<p>
			A <u class="one">null</u> was making fun of the <u class="two">null</u> one day for being slow.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Do you ever get anywhere?", he asked with a mocking laugh.
		</p>
		<p>
			"<u class="yes">null</u>", replied the <u class="two">null</u>, "but I get there <u class="speed">null</u> than I think. I'll run you a race and prove it."
		</p>
		<p>
			The <u class="one">null</u> was much <u class="verb">null</u> at the idea of runnning a race with the <u class="two"></u>, but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the <u class="three">null</u>, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled, "<u class="quote">null</u>".
		</p>
		<p>
			The <u class="one">null</u> was soon far out of sight, and to make the <u class="two">null</u> feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a <u class="one">null</u>. He went off the course to practice <u class="verb">null</u> for <u class="number">null</u> hours until the <u class="two">null</u> should catch up.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <u class="two">null</u> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the <u class="one">null</u> was <u class="verb">null</u>. The <u class="one">null</u> was so caught up in <u class="verb">null</u>; and when at last he did stop, the <u class="two">null</u> was near the goal. The <u class="one">null</u> now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the <u class="two">null</u> in time.
